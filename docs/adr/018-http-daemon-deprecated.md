# ADR 018: HTTP daemon is not a supported product surface

> Formerly numbered ADR 003 (duplicate). Canonical app composition root is [ADR 003](003-app-composition-root.md).

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The codebase previously carried an HTTP **`anycode daemon`** path (`daemon_http` and related wiring). That module was **removed** as unused / unmaintained relative to Desktop Workbench and `anycode-daemon scheduler`. Terminal CLI and IM channel bridges were later removed as well.

Documentation and roadmap items still referred to an “optional daemon HTTP” and “restore daemon” as an open question, which created false expectations.

## Decision

1. **Do not restore** the in-process **HTTP task daemon** as a first-class feature. No new work should reintroduce `daemon_http` or a parallel HTTP server inside the default CLI binary without a **new ADR** that explicitly supersedes this one.
2. **Integration model**: Remote or automated invocation should use **`anycode run`**, **`scheduler`**, **channel** commands, or external orchestration that shells out to the CLI — not a localhost HTTP API maintained inside this repository.
3. **Naming**: Other uses of the word “daemon” (e.g. WeChat **bridge** process) are unrelated to this ADR; they remain valid.

## Consequences

- Docs-site pages that described **`POST /v1/tasks`** are **historical / removed**; see the **HTTP daemon (removed)** stub (source: [`https://anycode.work/docs/guide/cli-daemon.md`](../../docs/user/guide/cli-daemon)).
- Maintainer backlog and MVP wording must **not** list “optional daemon HTTP” as in-scope.
- If a future maintainer needs HTTP, they should treat it as a **separate service or fork**, or draft **ADR 00x** with security, auth, and composition-root boundaries before landing code.
